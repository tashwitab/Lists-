TITLE: Lists 

AIM: To write a program using linked lists using class and pointers

THEORY:  In C++, a list is a linear data structure that stores elements sequentially. Unlike arrays, lists can dynamically grow or shrink in size. The Standard Template Library (STL) provides a doubly-linked list implementation through the `std::list` container. This means that each element in the list contains pointers to both the next and previous elements, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions at any position within the list. Lists are particularly useful when you need frequent insertions or removals in your code, but they have slightly higher memory overhead compared to arrays due to the storage of pointers.
