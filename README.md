TITLE: Types of List s in C++

AIM: To write a program using linked lists using class and pointers

THEORY:  In C++, a list is a linear data structure that stores elements sequentially. Unlike arrays, lists can dynamically grow or shrink in size. The Standard Template Library (STL) provides a doubly-linked list implementation through the `std::list` container. This means that each element in the list contains pointers to both the next and previous elements, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions at any position within the list. Lists are particularly useful when you need frequent insertions or removals in your code, but they have slightly higher memory overhead compared to arrays due to the storage of pointers.

ALGORITHM: 

1. Include the necessary header file `<iostream>`.

2. Declare a class called `node` to define the structure of a linked list node.
   - The class should have two public members: an integer variable `data` and a pointer to a `node` object called `next`.
   - Define a constructor for the `node` class that initializes the `data` to 0 and the `next` pointer to `NULL`.

3. In the `main` function:
   - Declare a pointer to a `node` object named `newnode1` and allocate memory for a new `node` object using `new`.
   - Set the `data` member of `newnode1` to 10.
   - Declare another pointer to a `node` object named `newnode2` and allocate memory for another new `node` object using `new`.
   - This step is incorrect in the provided code; it should set the `data` member of `newnode2` to 20.

4. Print the information of `newnode1`:
   - Print the data value of `newnode1`.
   - Print the self-address of `newnode1`.
   - Print the address stored in the `next` member of `newnode1`.

5. Print the information of `newnode2`:
   - Print the data value of `newnode2`.
   - Print the self-address of `newnode2`.
   - Print the address stored in the `next` member of `newnode2`.

6. End the program by returning 0.

CONCLUSION: In C++, lists are versatile data structures that offer dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations. Unlike arrays, lists allow for easy resizing without the need to specify the size in advance. They are implemented as doubly-linked lists, which means each element has pointers to both the next and previous elements, enabling fast traversal in both directions. Lists are particularly useful when elements frequently need to be added or removed from the middle of the list. However, they consume more memory due to the overhead of storing the extra pointers. Overall, C++ lists provide a valuable tool for managing collections of data with flexibility and efficient modification capabilities.
